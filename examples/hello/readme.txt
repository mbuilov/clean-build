# to build and test example, just run from this directory

make check

# Tips:
# make clean     - delete built files for the specified CBLD_TARGET/CBLD_OS/CBLD_CPU combination, except directories
# make distclean - delete all built artifacts: files and directories, for all CBLD_TARGET/CBLD_OS/CBLD_CPU combinations
# make config    - save build parameters to generated conf.mk, to not specify them again on next make invocation
