# to build and test this example, just run from this directory

make check

# Tips:
# make clean     - delete built files for current CBLD_TARGET/CBLD_OS/CBLD_CPU combination, except some generated directories
# make distclean - delete all built artifacts, whole $(CBLD_BUILD) directory
# make config    - save build parameters to generated conf.mk, to not specify them again on next make invocation
